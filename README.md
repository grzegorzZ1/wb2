# Generative Adversarial Network for enhancing Hi-C data resolution
We aimed to enhance the quality of Hi-C matrices, which provide valuable insights into the spatial organization of the genome. Our model focuses on enhancing small fragments (40x40) of the Hi-C matrix and subsequently combining them to obtain a complete version. Drawing on the DeepHiC architecture, we adapted the model by reducing the number of layers to accommodate resource limitations
