# Generative Adversarial Network for enhancing Hi-C data resolution
We aimed to enhance the quality of Hi-C matrices, which provide valuable insights into the spatial organization of the genome. Our model focuses on enhancing small fragments (40x40) of the Hi-C matrix and subsequently combining them to obtain a complete version. Drawing on the DeepHiC architecture, we adapted the model by reducing the number of layers to accommodate resource limitations

Saved generator and discriminator models are in the 'model' folder. In the 'code' folder there is notebook with code for the project along with requirements.
